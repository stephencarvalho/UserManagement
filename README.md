# User Management Application
This is a basic application developed with Angular for managing users. Each user consists of an id, email, first name, last name, role (doctor, admin, accountant) and status (active, inactive). The application allows you to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the user data.

This application is a client-side only solution, meaning that any edits done are stored in an object array.
